# Python-Practice-Exercises
A growing collection of Python practice exercises created while learning Python.

This repository contains small Python programs and exercises that I add to as I learn new topics.
The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python through hands-on practice.

🧠 Topics Covered So Far
  Conditionals (if, elif, else)
  Logical operators (and, or)
  Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
  Modulo operator (%)
  Functions
  Control flow

match statements (Python 3.10+)


📂 Structure
  Each exercise is stored as a separate Python file.
  Filenames reflect the topic or problem being practiced.

Example:
  compare.py
  grade.py
  parity.py


🚀 How to Run
  Make sure Python is installed.
  Open a terminal in the project folder.
  Run any exercise file:
  python filename.py

Example:
  python parity.py


🔄 Updates
This folder will continue to grow as I learn new Python concepts such as:

  Loops
  Lists
  Dictionaries
  Strings

  Object-oriented programming



✍️ Notes
